To specify which hardware to build for two manual steps are required:

1. Set MACHINE in "conf/local.conf"
2. Enable BSP and or other features such as QtAuto in "conf/bblayers.conf"

Available PELUX images:
* core-image-pelux-minimal
* core-image-pelux-minimal-update

* core-image-pelux-qtauto-neptune     (Requires QtAuto)

Build them by running: bitbake <image>
